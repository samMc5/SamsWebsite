<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="funnymessage.png" alt="Funny Coding pic" width="200"> <br/>

<p class="medium">My name is Sam McDermott, and I would like a career in IT.<br/>
   I have recently completed a 3 week computer coding course <br/>
   with the company <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/">CodeNation</a><br/>
   and after participating in this course, i feel more confident <br/>
   not only in my computer skills generally, but also in my desire <br/>
   to pursue a career in computer coding. </p>

<p class="medium">So far I have learnt some of the basics of computer coding (as <br/>
   much as you probably can in 3 weeks)</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Intro to coding</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Virtual Studio Code</li>
    <li>Built a Text-based game</li>
    <li>This website</li>
  </ul>
   <p class="medium">but i am hopeful in finding <br/>
   either an apprenticeship to further my experience, or maybe a <br/>
   project i could help out on, so if you have a project i could <br/>
   maybe help you with to gain some experience, please check out my <br/>
   <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a> page and get in touch.</p>
